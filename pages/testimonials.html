        <h2>Matthew</h2>
        <p>Jesus is just like the great prophet Moses in so many ways. He really is a royal descendant of David. The great messaiah has liberated us from sin.</p>
        </div>
      <div class="testimony-object" class="testimony-two">
        <img class="testimony-pic" src="/images/mark.png" >
        <h2>Mark</h2>
        <p>Jesus was a great man. He came to die for us, but he was still human, and is someone we should strive to be like. He felt emotions and gave up so much for us.</p>
    </div>
      <div class="testimony-object" id="testimony-three">
        <img class="testimony-pic" src="/images/luke.png" >
        <h2>Luke</h2>
        <p>He is the savior of all mankind, it doesn't matter if you are a Jew, Gentile, or American, he has infinite compassion for you. He is constantly looking out for the poor and helping the widows in need. He also makes a great effort to help the women feel loved and protected.</p>

      <div class="testimony-object" id="testimony-four">
        <img class="testimony-pic" src="/images/john.png" >
        <h2>John</h2>
        <p>For all who doubt his divinity, I testify that Jesus is the son of the living God. He performed many miracles and came to give his life for us.</p>

      <div class="testimony-object" id="testimony-five">
        <img class="testimony-pic" src="/images/matt.png" >

        <h2>Daniel</h2>
        <p>I know that Jesus is the Christ, and that he died for each and everyone of us. He cares about the individual and knows exactly how to comfort us. Because of him we can be free of our sins, and can learn to be like our father in heaven.</p>
