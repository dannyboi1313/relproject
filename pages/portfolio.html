          <h1>Miracle: Water to wine</h1>
          <p>My disciples and I were invited to a wedding and my mother noticed that the wine was running out. This is a big problem with lots of social implications. Even thought I was just starting out, I knew I had to do something. I had the servants fill the containers with water and by the power of God, they were turned into not only wine, but some of the best wine the people had ever tasted.

          <h1>Miracle: Feeding the 5000</h1>
          <p>
            I had just heard the terrible news that my good friend had been killed, and so I wanted to go away for the weekend to clear my head. A huge crowd of people found out I was near, and they soon gathered around me. Once I saw all of the people gathered around, I had compassion and healed some of the sick. I knew that we did not have enough bread to feed them, so by the power of God I was able to multiply the little bread we had.
            (Matthew 14:13-21)

        <h1>Miracle: Raising Lazarus from the Dead</h1>
          <p>I had a close friend who lost a friend of hers and so she came to me to see if there was anything I could do. I knew that anything is possible with the power of God, so I did not rush back. By the time I arrived, Lazarus had been dead for four days already, and the people complained that if I had only arrived sooner, I could have helped. I told them if they had faith, that God could still restore his life. So, I asked them where the body was, and when I saw him I wept, but I lifted my head and prayed, and by the power of God, he that was dead came forth.

        <h1>Miracle: Healing a woman in the crowd</h1>
          <p>There was a woman who had suffered with a blood problem for 12 years. She had gone to many doctors, but no one new how to help her. When she heard about me, she knew that I had the power to heal her. When I was walking one day, she came up behind me and touched my cloak because she though that if she could just touch my clothes she would be healed. Immediately she was healed, and she knew she was free from suffering. I told her that her faith had healed her and to go in peace and be free from her suffering.

        <h1>Miracle: Healing the blind </h1>
          <p>
            I once passed a man who was born blind. The disciples asked me about who sinned first, him or his parents, but I responded that neither did. I then told my discples that I am the light of the world and I made some mud on the ground and told the man to wash it in the pool of Siloam. He did and he was healed.(John 9: 1-12)

        <h1>Parable: The Good Samaritan</h1>
          <p>I was preaching to my disciples and a layer asked me about who whis neighbor was in reference to the scirpture that says to love your neighbor as yourself. I proceeded to tell him about a man who was traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho, where he was attacked by men who robbed him and left him for dead. Two religious men walked by him and passed on the other side of the road, but then the Samaritan walked by and had compassion on him. He bound up his wounds and brought him to an innkeeper and payed for his stay. This story is powerful because Jews have no dealings with Samaritans, yet he had compassion.

        <h1>Parable: The prodigal son</h1>
          <p>A man had two sons, and one of them asked for his inheritance early. He took the money and spent it all on riotous living. A famine came across the land and soon he had nothing. It even got so bad that he would have glady eaten the pigs food. He finally decided to go back to his fathers house in shame and see if he could work as his fathers servants. When he returned home, his father saw him from far out and ran out to him and kissed him. The son was confused and said that he wasnâ€™t worhty to be called his son, but the Father ordered his servants to fetch his best robe.

        <h1>Parable: The Ten Talents</h1>
          <p>
            There was a master who had three servants. Upon embarking on a long journey, he decided to entrust his servants to some wealth. To one he gave five talents, to a second he gave two, and to a third he gave one. Two of the servants used their money to invest and grow it, and the third decided to burry it. Upon return the master found that the two had doubled their money, and the third still only had the one. He rewarded the two to be master over many things, and he threw out the lazy servant.
          (Matthew 25: 14-30)
